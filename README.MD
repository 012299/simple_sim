Compares your equipped and new item in order to find your estimated DPS increase or decrease. Calculations are done based on a 5minute fight with bloodlust usage.

**Features**

- Similar results to 100k iteration SimulationCraft sims. Average difference of 0.03%-0.08% at worst.
- Rotation
-- Currently has support for the 3TP BoC rotation only. [Check BoC dps rotation for more info](http://www.peakofserenity.com/brewmasters-in-7-2-5-changes-and-tomb-of-sargeras/)
-- Can be used with 2tp or ED/HT, but haste will be under- or overvalued.
- Enchants & Consumables
-- When comparing items with enchants on them (cloak/rings) the calculation will assume the new item to have the same enchant.
-- If a foodbuff or flask is active, the stats will be used when determining upgrades. **May require an item to be re-equipped to update**
- Basic trinket support
-- Only the stats on a trinket are considered. Any item upgrade percentages when wearing a trinket with an effect *may* differ from SimulationCraft.

**Planned features**

- Item bonuses support
-- Legendaries' effect on dps.
-- Item set bonuses that increase dps, e.g. Jacin's Ruse.
-- Items with bonuses, e.g. Stabilized Energy Pendant.
- Enchants & Consumables
-- Combat potion support when calculating dps differences.
-- Hidden satyr neck enchant support when calculating dps differences.
